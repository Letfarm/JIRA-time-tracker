JIRA-time-tracker
=================

Letfarms JIRA time tracking

A script file used for adding time tracking buttons to the JIRA interface.

To use this in Chrome, install Tampermonkey, add a new 'user script', input https://raw.github.com/Letfarm/JIRA-time-tracker/master/tracker.js as 'Update URL'. This will allow Tampermonkey to update the script when new versions are committed.

In FireFox, GreaseMonkey should do the trick, though this hasn't been tested in GreaseMonkey
